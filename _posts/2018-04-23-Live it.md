# ARE COMPROMISES YOU MAKE IN RELATIONSHIPS HEALTHY? 

Do you know of anyone in a relationship who says yes to everything?

Whether this be with a significant other, family member, friend or work colleague; do they agree with absolutely everything the other person in the relationship says, wants, or does?

If your answer is yes, is the relationship balanced, fair, respectful, trusting, and honest? 

If your answer is yes again â€¦I will stick my neck out here and say that this kind of relationship exists only in the movies!  With all the unique differences between human beings, the likelihood of disagreement is virtually guaranteed.  Fact is, disagreement, when resolved, can create better relationships. In most situations, some form of compromise, incorporated judiciously, is critical to achieving resolution.

Compromise: An agreement or a settlement of a dispute that is reached by each side making concessions.
